hi I'm emerald Robinson and in this what

2
00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.069
is video we're going to investigate the

3
00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.150
state of matter called

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.059
a solid solids are materials that keep

5
00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.950
their form that is solids don't change

6
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.299
their shape or expand to fit the

7
00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.980
container that they are in although

8
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.199
there are many different solids there

9
00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.880
are a few characteristics that they have

10
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.789
in common first the particles in a solid

11
00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.380
are arranged so that they remain close

12
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.539
to one another but this does not mean

13
00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.910
that there is no movement at all

14
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.349
electrons still orbit the atom's nucleus

15
00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.110
and the atoms themselves vibrator jiggle

16
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.360
but the molecules in a solid always stay

17
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.480
in close proximity second solids can't

18
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.550
be compressed because there's not a lot

19
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.559
of space between the atoms they can't be

20
00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.149
squeezed together any closer than they

21
00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.719
already are

22
00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.210
sometimes scientists say that solids are

23
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.449
a condensed phase of matter third in

24
00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.219
general solids have melting and boiling

25
00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.050
points that are higher than room

26
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.910
temperature solids are sometimes

27
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.469
classified by how their atoms are

28
00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.719
arranged if the atoms in a substance are

29
00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.520
in a pattern the solid is known as a

30
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.188
crystal common crystals include metals

31
00:01:05.188 --> 00:01:07.860
ceramics and diamonds which are large

32
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.200
single crystals if the atoms in a

33
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.060
substance are not arranged in a pattern

34
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.490
the solid is called amorphous which

35
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.189
means without a form common amorphous

36
00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.250
solids include plastics and glass most

37
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.990
of the time solids are not made of all

38
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.090
of one kind of atom or even made

39
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.280
consistently of the same material these

40
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.500
types of solids are called mixtures or

41
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.259
more scientifically composites most of

42
00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.520
the things we see every day are

43
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.320
composites especially things in nature

44
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.900
like rocks wood and soil for thousands
